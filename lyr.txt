Easy

I do what I want
Whatever I do or don’t or I just take a rest, we gonna
I go with my gut
I win easily and move on to the next round
I’ll beat them all everyone and get to the top
 
I do what I want, I take whatever I see
Whatever I do, it looks good to me
I don’t regret my decisions
I pick out anything in my reach and go, let it flow
 
North, South, East, West, I crush them all
I don’t care. Or what? This is my own way
I've nothing to bring, lose your mind
Whatever people say, so what
Let go of everything, eat and have fun.
No matter what people say, live your life

Yeah put everything aside, knock out like it's all
Whatever I feel like doing, play it now like it's all
Everything looks so easy
I just make it easy
 
All of it, all of it, all of it
 
I make you say wow
Whatever I do or don’t, however I live
Look at me now
I turn things upside down

I make you say wow
Whether I throw the first punch or bust it all
Look at me now
I sweep everything away
 
Come and watch me now whenever it may be
Imma make it look, make it look, look so easy
Come and watch me now wherever I may be
Everyone will catch off guard, it’s so easy
 
As I’ve turned everything upside down
Should I relax and have some fun now?
All the commotion about me can just go away
The time that was so harsh, so terrible, so lonely for me
Can go sell gold

I followed the wind
Everything I said and wished for came true like this
I’m doubtful that nothing is easy
My doubts grow so stronger that they make me curious
 
I wanna let everything go and play without my mom knowing
I wanna let everything go and play with everyone
 
I’m nocturnal, I fly at night
I’m nocturnal, I make music at night
I cast magic spells in a magical castle
I let out my enchanting voice anywhere I go
 
Yeah put everything aside, knock out like it's all
Whatever I feel like doing, play it now like it's all
Everything looks so easy
I just make it easy
