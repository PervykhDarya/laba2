Easy

I do what I want
Whatever I do or don’t or I just take a rest, we gonna
I go with my gut
I win easily and move on to the next round
I’ll beat them all everyone and get to the top
 
I do what I want, I take whatever I see
Whatever I do, it looks good to me
I don’t regret my decisions
I pick out anything in my reach and go, let it flow
 
North, South, East, West, I crush them all
I don’t care. Or what? This is my own way
I've nothing to bring, lose your mind
Whatever people say, so what
Let go of everything, eat and have fun.
No matter what people say, live your life
